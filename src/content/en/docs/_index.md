# Getting Started

## What is Cloud2Gether?

Cloud2Gether is an AI-first, agentic DevOps platform built to support every phase of your cloud journey — from architecture and creation to operations, migration, and beyond.

Instead of relying on static tools and manual workflows, Cloud2Gether puts AI agents at the center of your cloud operations. These agents work alongside your team to continuously analyze, optimize, and evolve your infrastructure — helping you build a smarter multi-cloud strategy, strengthen resilience, and enhance security from day one.

Whether you're managing a single cloud provider or orchestrating across multiple environments, Cloud2Gether gives you the intelligence to move faster and operate with confidence.

## Platform Services

The table below lists the services available in the platform. Each service has its own dedicated documentation.

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| Catalog Resources | Provides a unified inventory of all your cloud resources across connected providers. Automatically discovers, categorizes, and maps your infrastructure so you always have a clear picture of what's running and where. |
| Resources Evolution | Tracks changes to your cloud resources over time. Gives you a historical view of how your infrastructure has evolved, helping you understand growth patterns, detect drift, and audit modifications. |
| Lock-In Analyzer | Evaluates your infrastructure for vendor lock-in risks. Identifies dependencies on provider-specific services and suggests alternatives to improve portability across cloud environments. |
| Stack Evolution | Monitors the evolution of your infrastructure stacks, tracking versioning, dependencies, and changes across deployments. Helps you understand how your technology stack is maturing over time. |
| IaC Adoption | Measures how much of your infrastructure is managed through Infrastructure as Code versus manually provisioned. Identifies gaps and provides a roadmap to increase IaC coverage across your environments. |
| Costs Analyzer | Analyzes cloud spending across providers and surfaces optimization recommendations. Helps you identify waste, right-size resources, and forecast future costs. |
