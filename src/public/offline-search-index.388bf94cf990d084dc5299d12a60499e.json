Traditional DevOps requires engineers to write scripts, configure tools, and manually orchestrate workflows. Agentic DevOps takes a different approach: AI agents that understand your intent and figure out how to achieve it.\nInstead of writing:\n# Traditional: You write the how - name: Deploy application hosts: production tasks: - docker_image: ... - docker_container: ... You say:\nDeploy my application to production with zero downtime The agent handles the implementation details.\nKey Concepts Agents Agents are AI-powered workers that manage your infrastructure. Each agent:\nHas specific capabilities (infrastructure, security, cost, etc.) Maintains context about your environment Can execute actions on your behalf Learns from your infrastructure patterns Agents are not just chatbots — they’re autonomous workers that can:\nMonitor your infrastructure continuously Take proactive actions based on policies Alert you to issues before they become problems Execute complex multi-step workflows Workspaces A Workspace is an isolated environment containing:\nConnected cloud providers Deployed agents Configuration and policies Team members and permissions Most organizations use one workspace per environment (dev, staging, production) or per team.\nProviders Providers are the cloud platforms Cloud2Gether connects to:\nAWS — EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, EKS, and 200+ services Azure — VMs, Storage, Functions, AKS, and more GCP — Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, GKE Kubernetes — Any cluster, managed or self-hosted Custom — Connect any API via provider plugins Actions Actions are operations agents can perform:\nAction Type Examples Query List resources, check status, analyze costs Modify Create, update, delete resources Monitor Watch for changes, alert on thresholds Automate Schedule tasks, create workflows Actions have built-in safety:\nDestructive operations require confirmation All actions are logged and auditable Policies can restrict what agents can do Policies Policies define guardrails for agent behavior:\n# Example policy name: production-safety rules: - action: delete resources: [\"*\"] require: approval - action: modify resources: [\"database/*\"] require: approval - action: query resources: [\"*\"] allow: true Policies ensure agents operate within boundaries you define.\nHow Agents Work ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ │ You │────▶│ Agent │────▶│ Cloud │ │ (Intent) │ │ (AI) │ │ Provider │ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ ▲ │ │ │ ▼ ▼ │ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ └─────────────│ Response │◀────│ Results │ │ (Human) │ │ (Data) │ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ You express intent — Natural language describing what you want Agent interprets — AI understands the goal and plans steps Agent executes — API calls to your cloud providers Results returned — Human-readable summary of what happened Agent Types Cloud2Gether provides specialized agents for different tasks:\nAgent Type Purpose Infrastructure Manage compute, storage, networking Security Audit, compliance, vulnerability scanning Cost Optimization, budgeting, waste detection Deployment CI/CD, releases, rollbacks Monitoring Observability, alerting, incident response Learn more in the AI Agents documentation.\nSecurity Model Cloud2Gether is designed with security first:\nLeast privilege — Agents only access what they need Audit logging — Every action is recorded Encryption — All data encrypted in transit and at rest No data storage — We don’t store your infrastructure data SOC 2 compliant — Enterprise-grade security practices See Security \u0026 Compliance for details.\nNext Steps Now that you understand the concepts:\nDeploy more agents Configure policies Set up team access ","categories":"","description":"Understand the fundamental concepts behind Cloud2Gether's agentic DevOps platform.\n","excerpt":"Understand the fundamental concepts behind Cloud2Gether's agentic …","ref":"/en/getting-started/concepts/","tags":"","title":"Core Concepts"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/categories/","tags":"","title":"Categories"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/","tags":"","title":"Cloud2Gether Documentation"},{"body":" Cloud2Gether Documentation Get Started API Reference The Agentic DevOps Platform — Automate your infrastructure with AI-powered agents\nCloud2Gether brings the power of AI agents to your DevOps workflows.
